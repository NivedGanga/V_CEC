# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: perman
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Permanent_Marker/PermanentMarker-Regular.ttf
    - family: kdam
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Kdam_Thmor_Pro/KdamThmorPro-Regular.ttf

      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/chalkiez-font/Font file/Chalkiez.ttf
    - family: cascadia
      fonts:
